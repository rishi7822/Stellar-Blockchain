Repo for the basic understanding of writing and depolying a smart contract using rust on stellar blockchain using soroban CLI


This README provides guidance on creating a smart contract on the Stellar blockchain. Smart contracts on Stellar are implemented using Stellar's native language, which is called Stellar Transaction Builder (STB).

Introduction to Stellar Smart Contracts:
Stellar smart contracts enable the execution of predefined conditions and actions on the Stellar blockchain. These contracts facilitate various functionalities such as escrow services, multi-signature setups, atomic swaps, and more.

Requirements:
Basic understanding of blockchain technology and Stellar network.
Familiarity with Stellar Development Foundation's documentation.
Access to a Stellar development environment or test network.
Getting Started:
Setup Stellar Development Environment:

Install the necessary tools such as Stellar SDKs, Stellar Laboratory, and Horizon server.
Set up a Stellar test network account to experiment with smart contracts without using real Lumens (XLM).
Understanding Stellar Transaction Builder (STB):

STB is the language used to define smart contracts on the Stellar network.
Learn about the syntax, operations, and functions supported by STB.
Designing Your Smart Contract:

Clearly define the conditions and actions your smart contract will perform.
Consider security, efficiency, and scalability aspects while designing the contract.
Writing the Smart Contract Code:

Use the Stellar SDK or Horizon server to create, sign, and submit transactions.
Implement the contract logic using STB syntax.
Test your contract thoroughly on the Stellar test network.
Deploying the Smart Contract:

Deploy the smart contract to the Stellar mainnet or test network.
Monitor and verify the contract's behavior on the blockchain.
Best Practices:
Follow security best practices to protect your smart contract from vulnerabilities.
Document your smart contract thoroughly to facilitate understanding and maintenance.
Test your smart contract extensively in different scenarios before deploying it on the mainnet.
